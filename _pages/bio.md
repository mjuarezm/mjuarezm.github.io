Marc Juarez is a Lecturer in Cyber Security and Privacy at the University of Edinburgh's School of Informatics. Marc obtained his PhD from the KU Leuven, under an FWO PhD fellowship. At the KU Leuven, Marc worked in the Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography (COSIC) group, where he applied machine learning techniques to a wide range of security and privacy problems. In particular, Marc's dissertation studies the application of machine learning to web traffic fingerprinting attacks. By developing novel website fingerprinting methods and identifying pitfalls in how these methods are typically evaluated, his work has contributed to advancing our understanding of the threat that they pose to web users. This work also contributed to the implementation of defenses in various privacy enhancing technologies and deployed systems. One of the publications stemming from the dissertation won the 2016 ESORICS Best Paper award, and the dissertation is a runner-up for the 2020 SIGSAC Doctoral Dissertation Award. Before joining the University of Edinburgh, Marc was a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Computer Science Department of the University of Southern California (USC), where he worked on problems related to privacy and algorithmic bias.
