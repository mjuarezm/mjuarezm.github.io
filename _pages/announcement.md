I am looking for a motivated PhD student with a solid mathematical background, some familiarity with the fields of machine learning, and security and privacy and, ideally, previous research experience. This is a full-time and fully funded position, and the call is open to UK/EU/International candidates.

The student will be working with me on one of these topics:

<ul>
    <li><p><strong>ML-Based Traffic Analysis</strong>: the development and evaluation of traffic analysis defenses from both a practical and theoretical point of view.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Security and Privacy of ML</strong>: the design of methods to audit privacy and security of ML models, and the development of privacy-aware ML techniques.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Privacy and Fairness</strong>: the privacy challenges that arise from identifying and mitigating algorithmic bias.</p></li>
</ul>

The <a href="https://edin.ac/3mIDdqN">Security, Privacy and Trust group</a>, located in the School of Informatics of the University of Edinburgh, provides a vibrant research environment and hosts several research institutes that are relevant to the research that the PhD student will be conducting.
