I am looking for motivated PhD students with a strong mathematical background and familiarity with the field of security and privacy and, ideally, some previous research experience.

The student will be working with me on one of these topics:

<ul>
    <li><p><strong>ML-Based Traffic Analysis</strong>: the development and evaluation of traffic analysis defenses from both a practical and theoretical point of view.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Security and Privacy of ML</strong>: the design of methods to audit privacy and security of ML models, and the development of privacy-aware ML techniques.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Privacy and Fairness</strong>: the privacy challenges that arise from identifying and mitigating algorithmic bias.</p></li>
</ul>

Please, get in touch via email for informal inquiries: &#60;first&#62;.&#60;last&#62;@ed.ac.uk
